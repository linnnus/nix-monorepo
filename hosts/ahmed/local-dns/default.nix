# This module sets up local DNS so that services on this host become visible to devices on LAN.
# The work is split in submodules, coordinated via the options set in this module:
#
# - certificates.nix: Get certs for HTTPS (surprisingly hard)
# - dns-resolver.nix: Make local domains visible to devices
#
# See the files for more info on how each part works.

          server anything public, as that would then be overwritten.
